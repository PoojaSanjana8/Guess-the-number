# Guess-the-number

## Description
The "Guess the Number" game is a simple Python program where the computer selects a random number, and the player must guess it within a certain number of attempts. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features
- The computer randomly selects a number between a specified range (default: 1 to 100).
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x or later

## Game Instructions
1. When the game starts, the computer will randomly select a number within the defined range.
2. The player will input guesses and the computer will provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
3. If the player guesses correctly, the game will end and display a success message.
4. If the player runs out of attempts, the game will display the correct number and the game ends.

## Sample Game Output
```
Welcome to Guess the Number!
I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 10 attempts to guess it.

Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 38
Correct! You've guessed the number in 3 attempts!

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, reach out to me if you want to do it.

Thanks!
